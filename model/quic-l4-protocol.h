 * \brief QUIC socket creation and multiplexing/demultiplexing
 *
 * A single instance of this class is held by one instance of class Node.
 *
 * The creation of QuicSocket are handled in the method CreateSocket, which is
 * called by QuicSocketFactory. Upon creation, this class is responsible to
 * the socket initialization and handle multiplexing/demultiplexing of data
 * between node's QUIC sockets. Demultiplexing is done by receiving
 * packets from IP, and forwards them up to the right socket. Multiplexing
 * is done through the SendPacket function, which sends the packet down the stack.
 *
 * Moreover, this class allocates "endpoint" objects (ns3::Ipv4EndPoint) for QUIC,
 * and SHOULD checksum packets its receives from the socket layer going down
 * the stack, but currently checksumming is disabled.
 *
 * \see CreateSocket
 * \see NotifyNewAggregate
